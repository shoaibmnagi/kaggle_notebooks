# Police Shootings and Racism in the USA: A Basic Analysis
A basic analysis of police shootings over the last six years in the United States using a dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset I used is called 'Data Police shootings' and it was uploaded by Andriy Samoshin on Kaggle. It contains all fatal police shootings in the US since 2015.
