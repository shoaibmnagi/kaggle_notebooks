# Kaggle Notebooks

This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks from Kaggle. For some notebooks, plotly graphs aren't visible on the GitHub preview. To view them, view the notebooks on Kaggle.

## [Fake Job Postings: Classification Using LR, KNN and SVC](https://github.com/shoaibmnagi/kaggle_notebooks/blob/master/fake-job-posting-prediction.ipynb)
I use the [Job Postings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction) provided by Shivam Bansal on Kaggle. After cleaning the data, I carry out some basic text preprocessing and vectorization. Then I use three different models to predict whether or not a job posting is fake. These include a Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (using Grid Search along with Cross Validation to find the optimum K), and Support Vector Classification. 

In the future, I plan on using a stacked model to see if it improves upon my False Negative Rate.

## [Police Shootings and Racism in the USA: A Basic Analysis](https://github.com/shoaibmnagi/kaggle_notebooks/blob/master/us-police-and-racism-analyzing-shooting-data.ipynb)
A basic analysis of police shootings over the last six years in the United States using a dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset I used is called [Data Police shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/data-police-shootings) and it was uploaded by Andriy Samoshin on Kaggle. It contains all fatal police shootings in the US since 2015. 

The Plotly graphs would not show up on the static preview here. Hence, for the preview, please visit the [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/shoaibmnagi/us-police-and-racism-analyzing-shooting-data).
